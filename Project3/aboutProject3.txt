Using the C programming language implement Heapsort in the manner described in class. 
Here is some example CODE to use as a guideline. Remember, you need only implement 
the sort algorithm, both the comparison and main functions 
have been provided. Submit a single C file called "srtheap.c" only!

The code provided is within the Project3 folder and uses the following header as a guidance 
for compilation:

/*
 *
 *  after splitting this file into the five source files:
 *
 *	srt.h, main.c, srtbubb.c, srtinsr.c, srtmerg.c
 *
 *  compile using the command:
 *
 *	gcc -std=c99 -DRAND -DPRNT -DTYPE=(float | double) -D(BUBB | HEAP | INSR | MERG) *.c
 *
